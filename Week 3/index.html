                <p class="question">1) Otters hold hands while sleeping, so that they don't drift away from each other!</p>
                <p class="question">2) Otters have a favorite rock. They will hold onto this rock until they give it to someone they trust, or until they die and give it to their children!</p>
                <p class="question">3) Otters use their favorite rock in order to crack open shellfish. They do this by picking the creature up, placing it on their bellies, and smacking it until it breaks open!</p>
                <p class="question">4) Otters, similar to dogs and crows, will remember people that they like. And, on some occasions, have been seen giving a human their favorite rock!</p>
                <p class="question">5) A sea otter named Rosa, who has recently passed away from old age, was famous for fostering 15 pups! This alone assisted in saving the coral reefs and kelp forests from an over population of urchins!</p>
